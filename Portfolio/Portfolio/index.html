       <h2> About Me</h2>
	   <p>I graduated high school in 2010. After that I tried out college and found out that I was not ready for the responsibilities and dedication required. I joined the workforce for a few years and then joined the Navy in 2013 where I stayed until 2016. Afterwards, I moved back home to North Carolina to start a web design business. It was where I got my first taste of the tech industry though I didn't know at the time. After a couple years, I started teaching myself Python on a whim to see if I could make a video game with. After trying for a few months to research the internet on culture programming, go back to college to be a Software Developer. In 2019 I started Wake Tech Community College and graduated in 2023. I am now at the illustrious Shaw University with a growing Computer Science program. Ever since I was accepted, there have been endless opportunities to practice my programming and even push myself beyond my comfort. Matter of fact, the Web Design class is more in depth than what I was doing for my web design business! I hope to continue to grow as a programmer in and out of the classroom and give back to the community.</p>
